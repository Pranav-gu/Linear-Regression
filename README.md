1) Irreducible Error is Calculated by Averaging it across data points in the Test Data Set. That is, it is not calculated by first calculating the Bias^2, variance and MSE for all test points and then MSE-Bias^2-Variance but by calculating Irreducible Error for each data Point By calculating MSE, Bias^2 and Variance for each Data Point, using Formula MSE-Bias^2-Variance and then Averaging out Irreducible Error for each Associated Point in the Data Set.
2) Everything else is done according to the specifications of the Assignment PDF with relevant plots and figures/tables attached in the Juypter Notebook itself.
